# tutoring-app-front-end

My first personal coding project since graduating from Northcoders Coding Bootcamp, the aim of this project is to build a full stack application for personal tutors, specifically tutors teaching children up to the age of 11, remotely.

The app will allow tutors to input information about their pupils. Fields will include name, address, DOB, school, year group, right/left handed, preliminary information such as starting date of lessons and contact details for parents.

There will be places for records to be held about each child such as books read, creative writing topics, work books and 11+ pre-test and test results.

There will also be an area of the app where homework can be saved until it is marked and deleted.
